- Product Filtering: Users can apply filters based on size, color, and gender to narrow down their product search and find items that meet their preferences.
- Sorting Options: The website provides sorting options to arrange products by different criteria such as newest arrivals, price (ascending or descending), allowing users to find products based on their preferences.
- Shopping Cart: The website includes a shopping cart feature where users can add products they wish to purchase. They can view the contents of the cart, update quantities, and proceed to checkout.
- Wishlist: Users can add products to their wishlist, making it easier to track and revisit items of interest for future reference.
- Responsive Design: The website is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal user experience across different devices and screen sizes.
- Dynamic Updates: The website utilizes dynamic updates to ensure that product listings, pricing, and availability information remain up to date by fetching data from a server using APIs.

## Technologies used
- React: The project utilizes React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React enables the creation of reusable UI components and facilitates efficient rendering and updating of the user interface.
- Redux: Redux is a state management library used in conjunction with React. It provides a centralized store to manage application state, making it easier to handle data flow and maintain consistency across components.
- React Router: React Router is used for handling client-side routing in the project. It enables navigation between different pages or views within the application without requiring a full page refresh.
- Styled Components: The project utilizes Styled Components, a CSS-in-JS library, for styling the components. Styled Components allow writing CSS code within JavaScript, enabling easy and dynamic styling based on component props and state.
- REST API: The project interacts with a RESTful API to retrieve product data. It utilizes HTTP methods such as GET and POST to communicate with the server and exchange data in a standardized format.
